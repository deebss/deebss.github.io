Over the weekend, I started one of my first personal projects. An online text editor/note-taking app with minimalism in mind. I call it MTE and it is overall very lightweight. I have added it to my projects page where anyone can access and use it. 

This editor is heavily influenced by {% include icon-github.html username="tholman" %} / [ZenPen][zenpen]. It is essentially my attempt at reverse engineering the editor in order to learn more about Javascript as well as web design principles.

At the moment, it is very minimal in terms of features, as it only bolds, italicizes and underlines selected text. Hopefully in the near future, I will add a night mode and even a way to save notes locally as .txt or .md files.

MTE can be found [here][MTE]
